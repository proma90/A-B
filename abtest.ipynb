This regression aims to provide estimates for the two constants, $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$, in the model shown below in which $p_i$ and $ab\\_page_i$ denote the convert rate and the landing page for the $i$-th observation, respectively.$$log\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * ab\\_page_i$$Based on this model, the null hypothesis for the logistic regression is that whether a conversion occurs is independent of the landing page and can be quantitatively expressed as the following.$$\\beta_1 = 0$$Although the p-value associated with ab_page is relatively small, this null hypothesis could not be rejected because this p-value of 19% is larger than the tolerance level of 5%. In fact, the coefficient associated with ab_page indicates that holding all other variables constant, the convert rate for the old page is approximately 1.02 times the convert rate for the new page. In other words, the results from the logistic regression and those from the sampling distribution and the two-sample Z-test all indicate that the company should not implement the new page but keep the current one.","metadata":{},"id":"c4289a48-c9d1-4488-8428-0c9961bbc1a7"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# multiplicative increase in convert rate for old page\nbeta1 = -0.0150\n1/np.exp(beta1)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":42,"outputs":[{"execution_count":42,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"1.015113064615719"},"metadata":{}}],"id":"c91bd600-b775-4eea-8e01-1436eac9c3fa"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This recommendation for the company can also be verified by converting the p-values between two-tail and one-tail tests.\n\n- In case of the two-tail test, the proportion of extreme values below the expected values from the null is half the p-value from the logistic regression or 0.190/2=0.095.\n- In case of the one-tail test, the proportion of extreme values that were larger than the observed statistic was approximately 91% according to the p-value obatined from sampling values from the null hypothesis.\n\nThe p-value from the two-tail test can be converted to the p-value from the one-tail test by excluding the proportion of extreme values below the expected values from the null, 1−0.095 = 0.905, which is approximately 91%. Again, because the p-value from either tests is larger than the tolerance level of 5%, the null hypothesis could not be rejected.\n\nIn addition to the landing page, there may be other factors which influence whether or not an individual converts. Adding these additional factors to the model may be beneficial in that the model may not only be fit more accurately but be generalized to predict outcomes from a new dataset. A potential disadvantage accompanied by this addition is the possibility of any correlation among the predictor variables added to the model to predict the outcome. In such case, interactive terms for the predictor variables which are dependent of each other need to be added, resulting in a more complex model which renders analysis of estimates less intuitive or more challenging.\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"86f6fa94-4aa5-4f30-98c0-0129b6bfde27"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

However, the magnitude of the increase is less than the increase which resulted from the addition of the country to the predictor variables. In other words, the capability of the model to predict conversion increased with the addition of the two interaction terms but not to a degree that was accomplished by the addition of the country to the logistic regression model.","metadata":{},"id":"06620703-ad9b-45b5-8fcc-0a7a97923556"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# logistic regression for conversion vs. page, country, including interaction terms\nlog_mod = sm.Logit(df_new['converted'], df_new[['intercept', 'ab_page', 'CA', 'UK', 'ab_page_CA', 'ab_page_UK']])\nresults = log_mod.fit()\nresults.summary()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":52,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Optimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.366109\n         Iterations 6\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":52,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<class 'statsmodels.iolib.summary.Summary'>\n\"\"\"\n                           Logit Regression Results                           \n==============================================================================\nDep.

In other words, according to the A/B tests, the company was not recommended to implement the new page because the convert rate for the old page was determined to be equal to or larger than the convert rate for the new page. Additional data concerned with the context in which the timestamp of each transaction was recorded or the interpretation of these timestamps would introduce potential improvements to the A/B testing in that outcomes of transactions can be monitored continuously. Findings from a more comprehensive analysis would provide the company with insights into the optimal duration of the A/B testing before the company makes a decision on implementing the new page or keeping the old page.\n\nThe logistic regressions did not provide similar p-values as the sampling distribution and the two-sample Z-test because the null and the alternative hypotheses for the logistic regressions were concerned with whether the outcome can be predicted with certain predictor variables. However, conversion of the p-value from the two-tail test to the one-tail test showed that the findings from the logistic regression also supported the null hypothesis. The first model aimed to predict the conversion with the landing page. The second model added country where the users live to the predictor variables of the first model. The third model included interaction terms among the predictor variables from the second model. From the first to the second and the third models, increase in the pseudo R-square suggested an increase in the capability of the model to account for the observed outcome and predict conversion.","metadata":{},"id":"301c85de-01b4-4850-b25a-80731544941a"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"8688484b-a032-44ad-99ad-8b76026eec09"}]}
